Wrapper for Komoot's Photon API for Dart/Flutter.

It supports forward and reverse geocoding as well as search-as-you-type.

## Photon

Photon is a free and open-source API hosted by Komoot and powered by ElasticSearch. It returns data from the OpenStreetMap project,
which is licensed under the [ODbL License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/).

The API is available at [photon.komoot.io](https://photon.komoot.io)
and licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Usage

Forward geocoding:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_photon/flutter_photon.dart';

void main() async {
  final api = PhotonApi();
  final results = await api.forwardSearch('munich');
}
```

Reverse geocoding:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_photon/flutter_photon.dart';

void main() async {
  final api = PhotonApi();
  final results = await api.reverseSearch(48.123, 11.321);
}
```

Self-hosted instances (custom URL):
```dart
void main() async {
  final api = PhotonApi(baseUrl: 'https://example.com/api');
}
```
